A multi page _**Shopping Cart**_ web application I built with HTML,CSS,JavaScript and React. It's multi page application, I used react router dom. Notifications are displayed when items are added or deleted in the cart, I use toastify for that and I use react icons for the icons. I fetch the items from a free api called fakeStore api.
